I am slim and I like minimalistic docements and presentations, so I like ot tweek templates. My modification are usually lot of different stack exchange answers stiched into one messy file. I am trying to clean it as much as possible, it is not always the case.


## Slim templates

[slim thesis](silm thesis) is based on thesis template of Petr Zemanek, available at : https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-theses-at-faculty-of-science-masaryk-university/vhxmptbnrmdq the original template used a lot of Czech variable names, I partialy translated them to English, but again, not all of them. There is still a lot of stuff inside I am trying to filter (but also a lot of nice tweeks I would like to keep).
[slim presentation](slim presentation) is based on beamer trimming a lot of ugly and redundant objects and several macros for common slides


## Other tools

[scripts](scripts) contains all scripts (currently one) I use for data driven prezentations and documents.
